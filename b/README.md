# Json Web Proof Merkle Disclosure Token

[Latest Draft](https://or13.github.io/jwp-mdt/)

Json Web Proof Merkle Disclosure Token is a bucket for
organizing merkle proof encodings for JOSE and COSE.

The spec does way to much in one place currently,
hopefully we can find other IETF specs to delegate to.

Specifically [JWP](https://github.com/json-web-proofs/json-web-proofs)

## Contributing

The main specification is written in the markdown, however to preview the changes you have made in the final format, the following steps can be followed.

The tool `markdown2rfc` is used to convert the raw markdown representation to both an HTML and XML format. In order to run this tool you must have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
